Hello, my name is Kelin Field.  I was born and raised in small town USA.  A little city named Vienna, IL.  Just a small skip off the border to Kentucky.  I moved to Chicago in June of 2013 where I studied and graduated with a degree in film and broadcast.  Filmmaking was something I had done since a young age and it was something I enjoyed, and still do, immensly.  However, it is not something that can be done without a significant amount of commitment, at least not properly.  I can't "work remotely" and I definitly cannot work solo.  I would need to move away from family and friends and relocate in one of the areas where production was a viable industry.

Despite my carreer choice, I ended up getting married in December of 2015 to my amazing wife Alexa (yes she loathes Amazon for their decisions).  We settled on the town square, in a beautiful apartment, in our sleepy home town of Vienna and I got a job working at a surveying and engineering firm right across the town square while she finished up her RN degree at the local community college. We found out we were pregnant at the end of January 2018 and so we packed up and hauled all our belongings across the street to our new home.

I was tasked with the typical duties of rennovating portions of the home that were outdated and enjoyed getting to learn new skills that allowed me to use my hands to create and build and make things new again.  I was an enourmous fan of Legos back in the day.  If I am being totally honest, I still am.  I had to have a kid to justify getting them out of storage.  Learning new skills or acquiring a new understanding of how things work has always been extremely satisfying to me.  I am what they call an autodidact.  I have a healthy yearning for knowledge and I seek it out and assimilate it. (Resistance is Futile!)

One day I downloaded Unity and started playing around with C#.  Following some tutorials on Youtube and trying a couple things yielded some acceptable beginner results.  From then on I was hooked on a new hobby, much to my wife's despair.  In her defense I do have quite the list of interests.  I enjoy my work and my work environment at the survey and engineering company as I have known most of my co-workers and my employer for many years.  However there was just something missing.  I felt as if I was slowly letting my passion for a fullfilling career slip away.

On October 10, 2018,  Pyper Lyn Field rocked our universe when she came into this world.  All of a sudden I had a family that depended on me to make good choices and that needed my attention.  I had a fairly decent job, good benefits, and work within eye sight of my living room windows.  It was better for a while.  I still coded when I could, but once you get familiar with something you begin to realize the complexity of doing anything marketable and I knew I wasn't going to have the time to make myself a game developer or software engineer on my own.

My buddy was also struggling to find passion in his career.  We both had been coding around for fun (we grew up playing games all the time) and we joked about being able to do this stuff for a living.  We halfbaked checked into some programs for software engineering but nothing really was coming of it.  One day he told me he had put in his two weeks and had applied to a program called Flatiron to become a full stack developer.  I looked into it and after a conversation with my wife, decided to take the plunge with him. (albeit not full time).  I still need to afford Taco Bell.... oh and my kid.

While my interests still lean towards game design and programming, my goal in anything is to be as flexible and as informed as I possibly can.  I enjoy being a swiss army knife employee, a jack-of-all-trades and master of... well as many as I can master.  You should never reach a point in your life where you think you know it all.  Life is too complex for a mindset like that.  I love learning and code is ever changing.  Code and I are just a good match. (But don't tell my wife)

That was a lot to take in, but if you have any questions or want to chat about anything, give me a shout on slack.

Yours Truly,

Kelin
